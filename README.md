Here is how the process works:

1. A userâ€™s browser makes a DNS request to Route 53.
2. Route 53 has a hosted zone for the vaskohandmade.com domain.
3. The hosted zone serves the record:
     * a. If the request is for the apex zone, the alias resource record set for the CloudFront distribution is served.
     * b. If the request is for the www subdomain, the CNAME for the externally hosted CDN is served.
4. CloudFront forwards the request to Amazon S3.
5. S3 performs a secure redirect from www.vaskohandmade.com to vaskohandmade.com.
